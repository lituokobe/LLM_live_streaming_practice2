# Deep Learning for Asset Price Movement Prediction

This project uses deep learning to predict the short-term movement of Adobe Inc.'s stock price. By training an LSTM model on five years of historical data (2020â€“2025), it forecasts whether the stock will rise or fall on the second trading day after a given input.

## ðŸ“Œ Core Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Analyzed Adobe's daily price movements over five years.
- Defined a reasonable threshold to classify price changes as "up" or "down".

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Three categories of features**:
  - **Price-based**: volume, return rate, average price trends, etc.
  - **News-based**: sentiment scores from daily news articles about Adobe.
  - **Macro-based**: NASDAQ index features, Federal Reserve interest rates, etc.
- **Total features**: 105
- **Feature normalization**: Applied tailored normalization strategies based on distribution types (bounded, normal, skewed, long-tail, clustered).
- **Feature reduction**: Used SHAP, VIF, and K-means to address multicollinearity and reduced to 40 features.
- Split data into training, testing, and evaluation sets.

### 3. Model Construction & Selection
- Built multiple LSTM models with varying depths and dropout configurations.
- Trained models on training and testing sets.
- Used TensorBoard to monitor accuracy, AUC, and loss across epochs.
- Evaluated models on the evaluation set using metrics: accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
- Selected the best-performing model for backtesting.

### 4. Backtesting
- Applied the final model to five years of trading data.
- Compared model-driven strategy vs. buy-and-hold strategy across:
  - Per-share return
  - Rolling Sharpe ratio
  - Drawdown curve analysis

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights

### Model Performance
- Final LSTM model achieved **30x per-share return** compared to buy-and-hold.
- Demonstrated strong resilience during market downturns and captured growth during uptrends.
- Maintained **positive rolling Sharpe ratio** most of the time, consistently outperforming buy-and-hold.
- Maximum drawdown stayed within **-20%**, far better than buy-and-holdâ€™s **-60%**, and hovered near zero.

### Key Optimizations
- Used large language models to automatically analyze five years of daily news and extract structured sentiment indicators.
- Applied histogram, KDE, boxplot, and Q-Q plot to assess feature distributions and select appropriate normalization techniques.
- Visualized feature relationships and multicollinearity using SHAP plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and elbow plots to guide feature reduction.
- Leveraged TensorBoard for detailed training logs and used confusion matrices and classification reports to evaluate model performance on the evaluation set.
