During the Ming Dynasty, Taoism was highly regarded and received imperial support, with the government actively promoting its practice and development. Notably, the Ming emperors, including Ming Taizu (the Hongwu Emperor), Ming Chengzu (the Yongle Emperor), and Ming Shizong (the Zhengtong Emperor), were known to personally revere Taoism. The Ming Taizu and Ming Chengzu, in particular, were followers of Taoist principles, and their patronage helped elevate the religion's status within the empire.\n\nDuring the reign of Ming Shizong, Taoism experienced a period of intense veneration. The emperor established Taoist temples and altars, emphasizing the religion's importance in state affairs and spiritual life. Additionally, Taoist clergy and practices were integrated into imperial rituals, and Taoist titles and honors were bestowed upon the emperor and his ancestors, including the conferring of Taoist posthumous titles for the imperial family. This state endorsement reinforced Taoism's prominence and ensured its influence extended into various aspects of governance and cultural expression.\n\nOverall, Taoism in Ming China was not only a spiritual tradition but also a state-supported institution that reflected the emperor's personal faith and the broader political and cultural priorities of the dynasty. Its development was shaped by imperial policies that fostered its growth, making it a central element of Ming religious life and a symbol of the divine authority of the emperor.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758805756, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 313, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 532, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
