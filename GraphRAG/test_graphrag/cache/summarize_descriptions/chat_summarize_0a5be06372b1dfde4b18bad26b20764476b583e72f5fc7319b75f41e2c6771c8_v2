It was a strategic area where Qing forces conducted military operations against Galdan, a prominent Mongol leader, as part of broader efforts to consolidate Qing control over Mongolia and its surrounding regions. Additionally, Khobdo was the site of conflicts involving local Mongol leaders and external forces. Notably, it was the battleground where 丹与岳锺琪 (Dan and Yue Zhongqi) engaged in combat against the Dzungar Khan Galdan's forces, specifically targeting the Dzungar leader Galdan and his general策零 (Ce Ling). These military engagements highlight Khobdo's importance as a strategic military zone during the Qing expansion into Central Asia and Mongolia. The region's history is marked by its role in the conflicts between Qing forces and Mongol and Dzungar factions, reflecting its significance in the broader context of Qing military campaigns and regional power struggles during the 17th and 18th centuries.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758805740, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 404, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
