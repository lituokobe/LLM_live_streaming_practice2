Historically, Hunan has been characterized by the presence of Tusi governance structures, which were indigenous administrative systems used to govern ethnic minority regions within China. These Tusi systems included specific administrative regions that allowed local hereditary chieftains or tribal leaders to exercise authority under the broader imperial framework. The province's historical governance included these Tusi administrative regions, reflecting a unique blend of local indigenous authority and imperial oversight.
