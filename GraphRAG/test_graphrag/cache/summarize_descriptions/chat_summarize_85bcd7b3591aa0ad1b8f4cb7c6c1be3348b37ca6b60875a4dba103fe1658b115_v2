Throughout this period, the Qing court was actively engaged in a range of significant political, military, and diplomatic activities. It was involved in ongoing efforts to implement constitutional reforms aimed at modernizing the governance structure of China amidst internal political struggles and revolutionary movements. These reforms sought to transition the empire towards a constitutional monarchy, but faced considerable resistance and challenges within the court and from revolutionary factions seeking greater political change.\n\nIn addition to internal political reforms, the Qing imperial government was responsible for making critical military decisions, particularly in response to internal unrest and external threats.
