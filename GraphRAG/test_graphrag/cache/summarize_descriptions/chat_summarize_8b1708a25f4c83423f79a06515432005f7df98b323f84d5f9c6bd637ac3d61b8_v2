Throughout its history, the kingdom maintained a tributary relationship with China, engaging in diplomatic and tributary exchanges that facilitated cultural and political interactions.

These exchanges contributed to the development of a unique cultural identity that blended indigenous Ryukyuan traditions with Chinese influences. The kingdom's diplomatic relations with China were characterized by formal diplomatic exchanges, including the sending of envoys and receiving Chinese officials, which underscored its subordinate but mutually beneficial relationship with the Qing dynasty.
