It was the capital of the Qing dynasty's northeastern region and played a crucial role in the dynasty's early expansion into China proper. From 1636 to 1644, Shenyang functioned as the official capital of the Qing Dynasty, acting as a secondary capital and a vital military base. After the Qing Dynasty established control over China proper, Shenyang remained an important strategic military garrison, where troops were stationed to secure the northeastern territories and maintain Qing authority in the region. Its historical significance is rooted in its role as a key military and administrative hub during the Qing Dynasty's formative years, serving both as a political center and a military stronghold in northeastern China.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758805737, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 360, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
