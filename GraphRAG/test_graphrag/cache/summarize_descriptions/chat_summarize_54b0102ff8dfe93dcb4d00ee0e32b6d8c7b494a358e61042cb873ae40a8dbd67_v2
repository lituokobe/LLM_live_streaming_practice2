These events were characterized by the suppression of dissenting ideas and the persecution of individuals whose writings or expressions were deemed politically or ideologically unacceptable by the imperial authorities. \n\nDuring Emperor Yongzheng's reign, \"文字狱\" manifested as a series of literary inquisition events aimed at controlling thought and maintaining political stability. These persecutions targeted scholars, writers, and officials whose works or statements were considered to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy or criticize the government. The Nanshan case is a notable example within this context, exemplifying the harsh measures taken against dissenters and the extent of political repression through literary censorship.\n\nLater, during the late reign of Emperor Qianlong, \"文字狱\" continued to be a significant tool for suppressing dissent. The Qing authorities intensified efforts to control intellectual discourse, leading to further persecutions of those whose ideas or writings were viewed as threatening to the imperial order. These persecutions often resulted in severe punishments, including imprisonment, exile, or even execution, reflecting the regime's determination to maintain ideological conformity and political stability.\n\nOverall, \"文字狱\" during the Qing dynasty represents a period marked by strict censorship, political repression, and the use of literary inquisition as a means to suppress dissent and control thought. It highlights the authoritarian measures employed by the Qing rulers to safeguard their authority and prevent challenges to their rule through the suppression of free expression and intellectual freedom.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758805741, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 553, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
