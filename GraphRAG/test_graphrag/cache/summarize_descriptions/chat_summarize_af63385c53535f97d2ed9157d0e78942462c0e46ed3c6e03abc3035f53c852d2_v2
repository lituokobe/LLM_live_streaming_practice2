During the 1911 Revolution, which led to the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China,湖南 declared independence, marking a significant moment in its history. Historically, during the Qing Dynasty,湖南 was an administrative region governed by a provincial governor, known as a巡抚, who was responsible for managing various administrative affairs within the province. This administrative structure reflects湖南's longstanding role as an important regional entity within China.
