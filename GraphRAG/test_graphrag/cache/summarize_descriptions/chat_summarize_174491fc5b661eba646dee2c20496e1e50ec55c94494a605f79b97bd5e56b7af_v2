Specifically, they dispatched troops to China and stationed forces in key areas, including Beijing and its surrounding regions, to establish control and safeguard their interests. These powers, which included influential Western nations and Japan, played a prominent role in shaping China's political landscape during this period by occupying strategic locations and exerting influence over Chinese affairs.
