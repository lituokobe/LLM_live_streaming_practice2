Initially, they maintained their own distinct language and cultural practices, preserving their unique identity during the early period of their rule. Over time, however, the Manchu gradually adopted Han Chinese language and customs, leading to a blending of cultural elements. In contemporary China, the Manchu are officially recognized as one of the country's ethnic groups, and their identity is acknowledged within the framework of China's multi-ethnic composition. The Qing government’s nationality law explicitly includes the Manchu among the various ethnic groups, emphasizing the multi-ethnic nature of Chinese society and promoting a recognition of diverse heritages within the nation. Overall, the Manchu have a rich historical legacy as founders of a major dynasty and have evolved culturally over centuries, maintaining their distinct identity while integrating into the broader Chinese cultural landscape.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758805752, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 373, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
