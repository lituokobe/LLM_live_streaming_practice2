Historically, Yunnan played a significant role in regional governance under the traditional Tusi system, a political structure used to administer frontier regions through local hereditary chieftains known as Tusi officials. These officials governed various regions within Yunnan, maintaining local stability and facilitating imperial control in areas that were often remote and ethnically diverse. The Tusi system was a distinctive feature of Yunnan's governance, especially during the Ming and Qing periods, reflecting the province's complex social and political landscape. Additionally, Yunnan's historical significance extends to its role in regional studies and historical events during the Ming period, highlighting its importance in China's broader historical and territorial development. Overall, Yunnan is recognized as a key province with a rich history of regional governance, cultural diversity, and strategic importance within China.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758805747, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
