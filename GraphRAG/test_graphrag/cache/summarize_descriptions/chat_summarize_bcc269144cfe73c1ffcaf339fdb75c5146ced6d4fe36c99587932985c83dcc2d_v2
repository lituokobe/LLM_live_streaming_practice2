During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Yangzhou served as a prominent center of scholarly activity and political faction formation, reflecting its importance as a hub of intellectual and political life in ancient China. The city’s historical prominence is further exemplified by its involvement in major water conservancy projects, notably during the Qing Dynasty, when efforts such as the dredging of the Yongding River were undertaken to improve water management and flood control. These projects highlight Yangzhou’s strategic importance in regional infrastructure development and its role in supporting agricultural productivity and urban stability.
