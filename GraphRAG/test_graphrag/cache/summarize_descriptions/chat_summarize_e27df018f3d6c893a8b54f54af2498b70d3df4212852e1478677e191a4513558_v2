Historically, it was known as Dihua, a name that reflects its long-standing significance in the region. As a key political, economic, and administrative hub, Urumqi has played a central role in the development and governance of Xinjiang. During the Qing Dynasty, it was an important city under the jurisdiction of the Urumqi Duhufu (military and administrative command), serving as a vital center for regional administration and trade. Today, Urumqi continues to serve as the provincial capital, functioning as a major center for regional governance, economic activity, and cultural exchange. Geographically, it is situated along the northern route of the Tianshan Mountains, specifically on Tianshan North Road, which underscores its strategic location in western China.
