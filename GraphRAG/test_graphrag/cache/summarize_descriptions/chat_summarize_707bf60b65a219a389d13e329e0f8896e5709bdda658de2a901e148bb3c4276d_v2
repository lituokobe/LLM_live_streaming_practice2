This area holds significant historical and cultural importance, particularly due to its association with the Manchu people, who established the Qing Dynasty, China's last imperial dynasty, during their rule from the region. The region has been a strategic military and political hub throughout Chinese history, owing to its geographic position and resources. In addition to its Manchu heritage, Northeast China is also home to a substantial Han Chinese population, contributing to its diverse cultural landscape.
