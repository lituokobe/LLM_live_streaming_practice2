During his reign, he implemented a series of political and territorial reforms aimed at consolidating power and improving governance. One notable reform was the reorganization of the military council, which he renamed the Junji Chu in 1730, thereby centralizing military decision-making and reducing the influence of regional or provincial authorities. \n\nAdditionally, Emperor Yongzheng initiated reforms to the Tusi system in several provinces, including Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The Tusi system, which involved hereditary tribal chieftains governing local areas under imperial oversight, was gradually transformed into a system of 流官制 (flow officials), a move aimed at integrating these regions more directly into the centralized bureaucratic structure of the Qing state. These reforms sought to enhance administrative efficiency and control over frontier regions.\n\nOverall, Emperor Yongzheng's reign was marked by efforts to streamline governance, strengthen imperial authority, and reform existing administrative and military institutions. His policies laid the groundwork for a more centralized and cohesive Qing administration, reflecting his commitment to consolidating imperial power and improving the stability and efficiency of the empire.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758805738, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 254, "prompt_tokens": 308, "total_tokens": 562, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
