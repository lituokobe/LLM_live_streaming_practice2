Its primary objectives were to unify various revolutionary efforts across China, promote anti-Qing activities, and ultimately establish a republic in China. The league aimed to overthrow the Qing Dynasty's rule, which was seen as corrupt and unable to modernize the country, and to replace it with a republican form of government that would promote national sovereignty, democracy, and modernization. The Chinese United League played a significant role in the early stages of China's revolutionary movement, serving as a unifying body for various anti-Qing factions and inspiring subsequent revolutionary activities.
