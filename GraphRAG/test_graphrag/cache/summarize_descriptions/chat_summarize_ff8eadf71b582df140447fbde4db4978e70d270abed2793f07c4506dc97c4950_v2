The most prominent and widely recognized instance of this alliance occurred in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. During this uprising, the Eight-Nation Alliance, comprising Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Austria-Hungary, and Russia, united to suppress the anti-foreign and anti-Christian uprising led by the Boxer movement. This coalition invaded China to protect their diplomatic and commercial interests, ultimately capturing Beijing and forcing the Qing Dynasty to sign the Boxer Protocol, which imposed severe penalties and concessions on China.\n\nIn addition to this well-known event, the term \"Eight-Nation Alliance\" also refers to a different coalition formed in 1931. This later alliance consisted of Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Austria-Hungary, and Russia, similar in composition but occurring in a different historical context. In 1931, this alliance invaded China as a response to the destruction of foreign legations, which was part of the broader tensions and conflicts during that period. The invasion led to the occupation of Beijing, marking a significant moment of foreign military intervention in China during the early 20th century.\n\nDespite the different contexts—one during the Boxer Rebellion and the other in 1931—the core composition of the alliance remained consistent, involving major Western powers and Japan. Both invasions exemplify periods of foreign intervention driven by imperialist interests, military conflicts, and China's struggles with internal stability and sovereignty during the late Qing Dynasty and early Republican era.\n\nIn summary, the Eight-Nation Alliance refers to coalitions of eight major powers, primarily Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Austria-Hungary, and Russia, that intervened militarily in China during two significant periods: first in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion, and again in 1931 in response to attacks on foreign legations, leading to the occupation of Beijing. These events reflect the broader context of imperialist conflicts and foreign domination in China during the early 20th century.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758805744, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 446, "prompt_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 683, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
