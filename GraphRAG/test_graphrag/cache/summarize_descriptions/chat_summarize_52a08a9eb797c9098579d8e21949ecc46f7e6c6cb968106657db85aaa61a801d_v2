In the late 18th century, specifically in 1784 and 1788, SIAM demonstrated its diplomatic relations with Qing China by sending envoys to pay tribute. These missions underscore the diplomatic and tributary relationship between SIAM and the Qing Dynasty, reflecting the broader regional dynamics of the time where states engaged in formalized tributary exchanges to establish and maintain diplomatic and trade relations. Throughout its history, SIAM's status as a tributary state to Qing China highlights its role within the regional political framework, balancing its sovereignty with the tributary obligations that facilitated diplomatic recognition and economic exchanges. This relationship was part of the broader tributary system that characterized East Asian international relations during that era, with SIAM actively participating through these tribute missions in the late 18th century.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1758805742, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_7c233bf9d1", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 380, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
