During its rule, the Qing Dynasty established and managed various territorial divisions, including provinces, banners, and leagues, covering regions such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, Xinjiang, and Mongolia. These administrative structures helped consolidate Qing authority across a vast and diverse territory.\n\nCulturally, the Qing Dynasty contributed notably to Chinese heritage by compiling ancient texts and fostering a relatively tolerant attitude towards certain publications, which facilitated the preservation and dissemination of knowledge. The dynasty also engaged in diplomatic negotiations and territorial expansion, strengthening China's borders and influence during its reign.
