克郡王和诸伯克之上，清朝还派驻伊犁将军，掌天山南北最高军政大权，下设参赞大臣一人辅之。又设塔尔巴哈台参赞大臣，喀什噶尔参赞大臣及帮办大臣，叶尔羌办事大臣及帮办大臣，和阗、阿克苏、乌什、库车、喀喇沙尔办事大臣等。乾隆末年以后，内地汉人和回民开始迁往新疆（以天山北路为主），把大片不用的牧场变为户屯。到十九世纪初，这些定居北疆的移民已达数十万人。在迪化（今乌鲁木齐），1808年时各县的民户农田数量已达到1775年的十倍[参10]。\n\n从乾隆后期开始，以沈垚、张穆、龚自珍等为代表的学者，均纷纷关心边疆事务，为国家献计献策。龚自珍大倡“回人皆内地人也”，无所谓“华夷之别”，并上疏安西北策，将新疆等同内地，主张“疆其土，子其民，以遂将千万年而无尺寸可议弃之地，所由中外一家，与前史迥异也”[参125]。\n\n外交\n\n总理各国事务衙门\n主条目：清朝外交\n参见：华夷之辨、朝贡体制、闭关锁国、不平等条约和大清建交列表\n外交机关\n\n恭亲王奕䜣，曾任总理衙门首席大臣、领班军机大臣、议政王\n清朝在近代以前并没有正式的外交机构，因当时清廷一向以天朝上国自居，除将俄国视为“与国”而进行平等外交外[318]，通常不愿承认与四周国家的平等关系。清朝的外交按照对象的不同，分由礼部、理藩院、内务府与公行制度负担外交事务。六部的礼部负责对日本、朝鲜、琉球与东南亚各国外交或朝贡事务，以维系朝贡体制。理藩院负责交涉东亚内陆如内外蒙古、准噶尔、西藏、俄罗斯帝国等事务，主要防止边患形成。其编制与六部基本相同，官员大多由满族、蒙古族人担任，汉人只能担任堂主事、校正官等少数官职。内务府除管理本身内廷事务，也管理欧洲来华传教士、宗教使节团的事务以及国外贸易的传运征收特别税。公行制度负责西洋各国如葡萄牙、荷兰、英国等贸易关系（在清朝来看仍为朝贡），限制于广州一地，又称广州制度[参199]。\n\n鸦片战争开启中国近代史，清朝对外关系转向被列强歧视。由于缺乏正式外交机构，为西方国家不满，在《天津条约》就有要求外国公使进驻北京，这使得中国正式开始面对新的外交形势。1861年，总理各国事务衙门成立，专门负责对外关系；然而，其地位逐渐被1870年成立的北洋通商大臣所取代。直到1901年的清末新政，将总理衙门改制为外务部后，才得以统一负责对外事务[参200]。晚清政府共与二十多个国家建立了正式的外交关系，并在多个国家（如\n######################\nOutput:",
