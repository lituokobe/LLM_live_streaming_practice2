建陆军（即北洋军），张之洞在南方组建自强军。1904年清廷正式建立由36个镇组成的常备军的计划，而绿营在1901年即开始裁减。同时取消武举，在各省建立武备学堂，以培养新式军官。负责军事改革的中央机构是1903年成立的练兵处，它在1906年被并入新立的陆军部，其尚书和左右侍郎都是满人。清廷试图削弱地方军阀力量，1907年袁世凯和张之洞就在明升暗调中被剥夺军权。1908年宣统帝的摄政王载沣决定进一步加强对军队的控制，在1909年的一道上谕中，他宣布自己（代表年幼的皇帝）对军队行使最高统帅权，他还把自己的兄弟任命为海军处和军咨府的管理大臣[参140]。到清帝国灭亡前夕，其陆军可以号称100万，但大概只有60万战斗人员，其中只有17.5万人是现代化的正规军。并非所有新军均效忠清廷，部分是暗中支持革命军的[参141]。参谋机制上，在1907年即仿照西制成立参谋部门军咨处，隶属陆军部之下。为把军事管理和军事指挥分开，1911年决定把它升格为独立于陆军部外的军咨府[参90]。\n\n海军\n参见：中国水军史、北洋水师、南洋水师和福州船政学堂\n清朝视水师为陆军之辅。加之满洲以骑射为本，故不善水战。入关初期，在对抗郑成功等海上抗清势力时，往往力不从心。1636年皇太极征满洲瓦尔喀部，即开始造战船。1651年顺治帝令沿江沿海各省循明制，各设水师[参142]，此为清朝水师之始。内河防务以长江为主体，沿岸各设水师。海防上，清朝为封锁明郑的经济力量，实施海禁。即使在平定明郑后，仍受海禁影响，水师多以防御为主，缺乏攻击性战舰[参143]。嘉庆时由于东南沿海海盗泛滥，就有学者开始注意海防，如湖南的严如煜写有《海防辑要》。鸦片战争后在面对西方炮舰时，清朝水师一战即溃的事实让魏源、郑复光等人意识到东西方的差距，纷纷提倡建立现代化海军。太平天国兴起时，英国协助清朝建立中英联合指挥的阿思本舰队，然而指挥权的问题使得舰队解散[参144]。\n\n\n铁甲舰镇远是当时北洋主力舰，也是亚洲少见的铁甲巨舰之一\n直到自强运动时，清朝才有新建海军的动作。为建立船舰自制能力，1866年清廷在福州马尾成立总理船政事务衙门，以沈葆祯为船政大臣。同年，李鸿章要求其江南制造局建造炮舰。1868年8月，第一艘中国制造的蒸汽军舰，“恬吉”号下水[参145]。然而自制船舰与外国舰队相比较差也较�\n######################\nOutput:",
