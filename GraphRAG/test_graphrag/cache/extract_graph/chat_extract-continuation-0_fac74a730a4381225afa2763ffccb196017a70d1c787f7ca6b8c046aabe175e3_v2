自称为“中国”，首次在法律上赋予了现代国籍法和“中国国籍”的意义。次年经清朝学部审定发行的教科书《中国历史教科书（原名本朝史讲义）》一开篇即表示：“本朝史者，中国史之一部，即全史中之最近世史。中国之建邦，远在五千年以前，有世界最长之历史。又有其文化为古来东洋诸国之冠。其疆域奄有东方亚细亚之什九，其兴衰隆替足以牵动亚细亚列国之大势。故中国史之范围，实占东洋史全体之太半”。[参27] [参28]\n\n中西史学家如黄兴涛博士及新清史学派学者、东亚史学家欧立德认为，康雍乾之后的中国，是被清朝皇帝、满人、汉人等其他族群共同认同并加以再造过的中国[参29][参30]。现代“中国”的概念，正是来自于清朝所塑造的中国观[参31]。\n\n明朝后金对峙图与关宁锦防线\n15世纪初期，位于东北亚的女真族大致分成三部分[注 19]，其中以建州女真最为强大。建州女真源自于辽金时代生女真完颜部的附属五国部，居于牡丹江与松花江汇流地方，在元代组成为五个女真万户府，元末因受野人女真及朝鲜滋扰不断，以及明朝的招抚等因素，其残余部族选择归附明朝。明朝将其部迁至原渤海地（今绥芬河流域）设置为他们新的聚居地。\n\n1403年明朝依据原渤海建州的地名称呼为建州女真，并设置了卫所这一地方军事行政机构，册封李承善为建州卫指挥使，猛哥帖木儿为建州卫左都督。其后1416年又建立建州左卫，以猛哥帖木儿为指挥使，并赐姓童。建州卫早期归属奴儿干都司，奴儿干都司废除后改属辽东都司。\n\n猛哥帖木儿在被野人女真所杀后，其弟凡察与子董山被迫率众南移，最后定居赫图阿拉（今辽宁新宾），并入建州卫内[参32]。1442年，明朝又从建州左卫分立出右卫，以凡察领导右卫、董山领导左卫，形成建州三卫[注 20]，三卫首领也是世袭制，但须经明朝政府认可后方生效。\n\n由于建州三卫对明朝过度干预女真产生不满，因而逐渐不遵守朝廷命令。而此时女真各部也因嫌隙已四分五裂。1467年明朝联合朝鲜削弱建州三卫（即成化犁庭），并且于辽东边界兴建长城。明朝万历初年，董山的后代觉昌安与其子塔克世偕同明朝辽东总兵李成梁，以建州右卫王杲叛乱为由攻灭王杲与其子阿台，然而觉昌安同其子塔克世在入城劝降叛明的阿台时发生混战，觉昌安父子也在混战中被明军误杀死亡。1586年明廷袭封塔克世之子努尔哈\n######################\nOutput:",
