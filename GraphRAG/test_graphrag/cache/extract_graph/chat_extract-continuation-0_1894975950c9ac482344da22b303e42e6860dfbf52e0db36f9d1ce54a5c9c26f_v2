地区占44个，可见明政府对江南水利的重视。治黄主要的目的是为了保障大运河的漕运。在永乐一朝，政治中心北移，而经济中心却在南方，因此粮食都需要从南方运过来。成化七年，明廷置河道总督，专管黄、淮等河堤疏浚诸事。[77]:246-276\n\n在明朝，特别是明朝中后期，经济作物的种植得到发展。政府推行了“折色”的税收方式，可以改征其他实物或银钱以代替粮食作赋税，鼓励百姓不只裁种粮食作物。棉花在成化、弘治年间“其种已遍布于天下，地无南北皆宜之，人无贫富皆赖之”[m]，农民摸索出种植棉花的新方法，提高了产量，棉花取代了丝、麻成为一般人纺织制衣的原料。其他经济作物的种植都得到的快速的发展，如蓝和红花等染料作物、花生、胡麻等油料作物、甘蔗、茶树、果树、蔬菜、花卉等。烟草在万历年间引入中国，很快就推广至全国栽种。[77]:276-295粮食作物方面，栗米和番薯在明中后期传入了中国，使旱地和山地得到利用，增加了全国粮食产量。[78]:262-263\n\n商业\n明朝初期，政府的户役制度、商税制度、海禁政策等政策限制了商业发展，各地以自然经济为主。[77]:479-492正统至嘉靖年间，市场上的商品种类大增，流通的范围扩大，出现了很多商业市镇。据不完全统计，明朝的商税由弘治时期共46180090贯升至嘉靖时期52068109贯，反映这时期商业的繁荣。[77]:492-503嘉靖中期之后，随丝织业、陶瓷业等手工业发展，商品生产领域扩大，货品数量大增，农产品亦开始商业化。全国形成了若干个以产品著名的地区，货品生产呈现分工的倾向，同时商品在各地区之间交流，乃至一些中小城市或者偏远山区的货品也相当齐全。如四川建昌卫（今四川西昌）也可以买到苏州、杭州的丝绸。在此时，一些商人为了扩大资本，成了商帮，控制了某些地区、行业的商业贸易。[77]:503-533\n\n交通\n明朝首先兴建的是两京与十三布政司之间的大道。为了巩固北方边防，以北京为中心，明政府共修建了11条道路。在永乐年间，为了巩固在东北的管治，修建了以开原为中心的四条驿道和以海西为中心的两条道路。明朝中期，随商品经济的发展，很多富民、商人为了商品流通、方便运输，大量兴修道路桥梁。整体而言，在各级官府和商民的努力下，形成了紧密的交通网。据黄汴《天下水陆路程》等统计，两京至十三布政司，各布政司至各府，以及各省之间的水陆交通干线二百有余。[77]:617-623\n\n主要的交通道路有以下五条：[77]:623-629\n\n京杭大运河。元末明初，运河淤塞而使用海运。永乐九年，宋礼率军民�\n######################\nOutput:",
