�“活泼畅快，汪洋恣肆”，有《四声猿》、《歌代啸》等。[84]:83-93\n\n艺术\n明朝书法。洪武至成化年代，以沈度为代表的台阁体书法家群人数虽多，但书风大多平庸无味。弘治至隆庆一朝，吴门派的祝允明、文徵明等人主张复古，一改前朝恶习，此时的著名刻帖有文徵明《停云馆帖》、华夏《真赏斋帖》等、吴廷《余清斋帖》等。万历崇祯年间，泰州学派和李贽的思想影响了当时的书法，书法自元以来再一次创新。董其昌的书法追求简淡空灵，独开门户，在明末清初成为了正统一派。王铎的行草恣肆纵横、粗服乱头，其风格影响了入明后的明遗民书法家。[85]\n\n明朝绘画。洪武永乐二朝的绘画大多沿习元代。宣德至弘治一朝，浙江与福建两地继承南宋院风的画家相继入宫，此时的宫庭话大多取法南宋院体画。人物画有商喜《明宣宗行乐图》、谢环《权园雅集图》等、山水画有李在《琴高乘鲤图》、王谔《江阁远眺图》等。正德年起，苏州地区出现了以沈周、文徵明的吴门派，以山水画见长，作品多描写江南风景和文人生活。吴门派在当时影响巨人，多有人从学。万历崇祯二朝，绘画多有创新。徐渭完善了大写意花鸟画画法。陈洪绶等开创变形人画法。董其昌重视画论上主“士气”，倡“南北宗”之说，创立了松江派，取代了吴门派地位。[86]\n\n明朝建筑。明代的建筑工艺创下新成就。南京和北京城池都是伟大的建筑作品。应天府京城城墙营建于洪武二年，完成于洪武十九年，城墙周长达66里，一般宽10-18米，高12-15米，是世界上最长的城墙。南京城突破方正的格局，而是按照地理形势修建。皇城位于东部，市肆和居民区位于南部，西北则是军营。洪武二十三年起，明政府开始修建京师外郭城（即南京外城），周围120里，开十六门，将雨花台和锺山都包入其中。而北京城池则较为方正，体现皇权至上的思想。明朝的宫殿建筑也十分宏伟，故宫即为例证。明朝各种历制建筑也十分严谨工整。天坛、太庙、社稷坛、孔庙都是十分巍峨庄严的建筑。明代帝陵工程浩大，可谓历代之最。而在明代被重建的万里长城（明长城）更是举世无双的巨作，保卫明朝的边疆，至今依然耸立。[12]:119-126\n\n明朝赏灯。始于永乐七年（1409），这年正月初十，永乐皇帝下诏，上元节“听军民张灯饮酒为乐，五城兵马驰夜禁，著为令。”（《明太宗实录》卷87）。始于天顺八年（1464）\n######################\nOutput:",
