”只在广东通商，不得再赴浙江等地，而不是一些资料中所说的关闭江、浙、闽三海关，更不是“广州一口通商”。\n\n鸦片战争前美国和英国两个航海大国的船舶总吨位的总和一度逊于清朝，当时中国沿海商船总数约在9,000至将近10,000艘之间，约有150万吨。加上其他种类的船舶，全国总有大小江海船舶20多万艘，共计400多万吨。而在1814年，英国全国有大小21,500多艘船，共240万吨；美国在1809年全国有船舶135万吨[参203]。\n\n\n一幅描绘列强瓜分中国情形的漫画。英、德、俄、法、日尝试瓜分中国这个大饼，后面的清朝官员无力阻止\n西风东渐\n18世纪，欧洲各国普遍流行中国风尚，当时欧洲人对中国普遍持正面和向往的态度，例如被誉为“法兰西思想之父”的法国启蒙时代思想家伏尔泰就曾高度赞扬当时在位的乾隆帝及中国的政治和文化[参204]。不过与此同时亦存在不同的声音，佩雷菲特指出1792年外交失败的英使马戛尔尼回程路上写的纪事中就包含批判性的看法[注 55]。然而马戛尔尼在他的日记《A Journal of an Embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China》里对清朝的平民百姓的日常生活、官员对下属的态度、统治者的仪态以至整体社会和国家的法律制度有多处正面评价[参206]。\n\n有学者指出，在乾隆以后，清朝开始实行“闭关锁国”政策，一开始是四口通商，到后来只有广州开放对外通商，且由十三行垄断其进出贸易。当时西洋的科技发展蓬勃，渐渐地超越奥斯曼帝国为首的伊斯兰世界和以清朝为首的东方世界[参85]。\n\n但也有学者指出，“闭关锁国”实际上是西方侵略者强加在清朝头上的贬词，反映出当时对华虎视眈眈的西方国家不顾事实反诬清朝排外，又指出就算是当时西方各国的口岸也只容许本国船只进出，本国的进口货物只容许本国船或原产国船装运，称之为“保护政策”，但又同时强迫其他国家洞开国门，任由他们自由离去和垄断，是为双重标准。此外，英使马戛尔尼曾向清朝提出六项要求，当中包括：\n\n要求英国货船能到浙江、天津等地收泊；\n要求在北京设立商行；\n要求在珠舟山占一岛屿，以便英国人居住和收存货物；\n要求在广州城划一地方居住英国人，或者居住澳门之人出入自便；\n要求准许英商从广东内河航行澳门，货物不纳税或少纳税；\n要求确定关税条例。\n乾隆帝随之复书批驳英国使臣的要求，有学者认为信中虽有妄自尊大的一面，但一些史学家往往断章独引“天朝物产丰盈，无所不有，原不藉外夷货物以通有无”这句话证明清朝“闭关锁国”，对英国侵犯中国领土完整及关税自主的六项要求避而不谈。清廷为了防止�\n######################\nOutput:",
