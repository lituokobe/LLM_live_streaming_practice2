如宗室内有一善人，满洲内亦有一善人，朕必先用宗室；满洲内有一善人，汉军内亦有一善人，朕必用满洲；推之汉军、汉人皆然，苟宗室不及满洲，则朕定用满洲矣。”[参172][参173]。\n\n清朝时期，八旗子弟（以满洲为主，也包含蒙汉八旗子弟）在政治或生活领域主要在教育、科考、补缺、律法、生活待遇等方面享有一定特权待遇。清廷特为宗室子弟特设宗学，觉罗子弟有觉罗学，普通八旗子弟有咸安宫官学等八旗官学，内务府子弟有景山官学等[参174][参175]。在文武科举之外，还提供笔帖式、翻译士、皇帝侍卫等方式供旗人子弟进入仕途[参176][参177]。高层官职也一向有旗缺与汉缺之分。旗人可酌任汉缺，反之除极个别情况外[注 51][注 52]，理论上是不可能的。能力不足以登科做官的旗人可以从参与最基本的挑选八旗兵丁做起，旗人子弟中的未成年者还可以参与类似于预备役制度的“养育兵”选拔，按月可得一定薪资[参178]。清代旗汉亦不同刑，若正身旗人[注 53]犯充军、流刑罪者有免发遣以枷号代替的特权[参179]。满洲人的司法权也独立于汉人之外。例如，驻防旗人触法不归当地督抚管制，而由该地区驻防将军、都统负责。京旗子弟则由步军都统衙门负责处理、宗室则由宗人府全权裁决。清廷还分拨旗地和营房给八旗子弟居住生活，不必承担任何赋税。旗地和营房受国家保护，不得私自买卖[参180]。清廷在全国各处八旗驻防地实施旗民分治，驻防地俗称“满城”，专供兵丁居住，非旗人不得随意出入满城[参181]。\n\n东北满洲故地无满城之分，清初设置柳条边，防止汉人及外藩蒙古进入“龙兴之地”[参182]。然而在康熙、乾隆、嘉庆年间有多次汉人移居中国东北地区的记载：“其吉林宁古塔、伯都讷、阿勒楚喀、拉林等地方，乾隆二十七年定例不准无籍流民居住。及三十四年，吉林将军傅良奏：“阿勒楚喀、拉林地方流民二百四十二户，请限一年尽行驱逐。”上曰：“流寓既在定例之前，应准入籍垦种，一例安插，俾无失所。”嘉庆中，郭尔罗斯复有内地新来流民二千三百三十户，吉林有千四百五十九户，长春有六千九百五十三户，均经将军奏令入册安置。其山东民人徙居口外者，在康熙五十一年已有十万馀人。圣祖谕：“嗣后山东民人有到口外及由口外回山东者，应查明年貌籍贯，造册\n######################\nOutput:",
