�权与今日之最高法院相似。大理寺的首长称为大理寺卿，也是九卿之一。其余四个寺的卿职权较低。太常寺负责祭祀；太仆寺管理马匹；光禄寺负责寿宴；鸿胪寺负责接待外宾[参10]。\n\n都察院是最高监察机关，架构基本沿袭明制，以左院察京畿，右院刺外藩（故直省督抚均领右都御史或右副都御史衔），所不同者，随着君主专制的高度加强，都察院的谏诤职能遭到空前削弱。因为同样的原因，明朝具有批驳权和言官职能的六科也只余下分察六部的监察职能，故于雍正年间被并入都察左院。为加强监督管理，凡天下文武官员，都要定期进行考察。规定三载考绩，以定升降奖惩。京官叫“京察”，外官叫“大计”。对武官的考察，每五年一次，称为“军政”，由兵部主持。但是，不论“京察”、“大计”还是“军政”，在实行中都是瞻徇情面，弊端丛生。后来更成为故事具文，走走过场而已[参10]。\n\n内廷事务方面，鉴于明朝太监乱国，清朝皇帝独创内务府以管理宫禁事务。其成员由内务府三旗（正黄旗、镶黄旗、正白旗）的15个包衣佐领、18个旗鼓佐领、两个朝鲜佐领、一个回子佐领和30个内管领的包衣及太监组成，其机构组织兼容清初内务府和十三衙门两种制度的内容和特点，并最终形成以七司三院为主干兼辖其他40余衙门的庞大的宫廷服务机构[参10]。\n\n宗室管理方面，清朝仍设宗人府管理宗室觉罗事务，但与明朝宗人府人浮于事只用于优待亲王的状况不同，由于八旗制度的存在，数量庞大的宗室觉罗成为清廷的核心军事力量，管理他们的宗人府也成为重要的实权部门。\n\n清末新政中，对此前的制度进行大量的改革，此前的七部院被改革为十一部，长官（国务大臣）均为责任内阁阁僚；大理寺改组为大理院，根据司法独立原则不再是刑部的复审机关，而是全国最高审判机关，与最高监察机关都察院同为全国最高司法机关；下四寺进行省革而归入新官司，内务宗人两府尽管保有旧时职权，但随着军制改革，权力也大为下降。\n\n刑律\n主条目：大清律例\n参见：文字狱和剃发令\n顺治四年（1647年），《大清律例》编修完成。《大清律》基本上承袭《明律》的内容。后经康熙、雍正两朝屡次增删，并于雍正五年公布。但清朝最经常起作用的是例，而不是律。胡林翼说：“《大清律》易遵，而例难尽悉。”，胥吏都谙熟例案，常可执例以压制长官。清廷对各少数民族地区还有各种特订的法律，如对蒙古族有“蒙古律”，对\n######################\nOutput:",
