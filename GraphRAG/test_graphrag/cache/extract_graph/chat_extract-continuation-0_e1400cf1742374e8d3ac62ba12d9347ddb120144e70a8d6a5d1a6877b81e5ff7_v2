陈报。但其对于其体制改革有限，最后因为朝野强烈的反弹声浪而妥协，未能扭转清朝颓败的趋势。此时八旗兵与绿营军纪腐败不可堪用，只能靠地方地主势力的团练平定乱事。而后期更由此形成湘军与淮军等地方军。嘉庆末年民乱不断，有白莲教的川楚教乱、东南有海盗侵袭，华北又有天理教之乱，清廷自此走向败落。\n\n\n《道光帝情殷鉴古像》\n1820年，嘉庆帝崩，旻宁继位，即道光帝。此时，朝廷暮气沉沉，满朝文武只知迎合贪污谎报。道光帝即位之初，励精图治、振衰起敝、提倡俭朴，所穿龙袍是宫内旧料所制，满朝文武故意在朝服补丁，以示简朴。 陶澍改革漕运盐政，使用海运替代河运，克服了漕运的障碍。实行行票盐制，使两淮盐政保持“弊肃风清”。道光七年（1827年），平定新疆张格尔之乱，中央政府对新疆的管治得到了巩固，此后新疆地区维持了较长的和平。但因体制改革不够彻底，到了嘉庆执政中后期，大臣们官官相护、结党营私、买官鬻爵，奏章大多报喜不报忧，致使鸦片禁令形同具文。导致鸦片泛滥、军队废弛、国库亏空、民变四起[参74]。曹振镛是当时第一重臣，奉行“多磕头，少说话”哲学[参75]。继起的穆彰阿，人称“在位二十年，亦爱才，亦不大贪，惟性巧佞，以欺罔蒙蔽为务”。鸦片战争时，前方将帅不断撒谎[参76]，败将奕山竟被钦命交部优叙。尽管嘉道二帝倾力维护清廷的稳固，然不可逆转历史发展趋势，内有太平天国之乱、捻乱以及陕甘回变与云南回变，外有鸦片战争等外患，一度使清廷摇摇欲坠[书18]:113-115。\n\n近代忧患\n参见：中国近代史、鸦片战争、南京条约、太平天国、湘军南京屠城、英法联军之役、火烧圆明园、天津条约、北京条约和瑷珲条约\n\n1841年鸦片战争虎门之战期间，英国战舰击毁一艘清朝戎克船\n\n1842年鸦片战争后，中国与英国签署《南京条约》\n19世纪上半叶，西方各国为使通商正常化，多次派使者前往中国协商。然而清政府以天朝上国自居，不愿与西方各国平起平坐，屡次不了了之。当时不列颠帝国对中国茶叶与丝绸的需求庞大，对华贸易成逆差状态。为此，英国将鸦片大量输入中国以改善贸易逆差。1838年鸦片增至四万零二百箱[参77][参78]。道光帝为解决此弊端，派林则徐\n######################\nOutput:",
