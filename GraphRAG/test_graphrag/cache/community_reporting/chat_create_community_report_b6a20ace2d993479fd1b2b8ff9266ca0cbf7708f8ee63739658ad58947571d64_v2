This policy restricted foreign contact and limited interactions with other nations, including Qing China, to maintain internal stability and cultural integrity. Despite this isolationist stance during much of the Edo era, Japan's interactions with China were limited but notable, with contact being carefully controlled. In the late 19th century, Japan's foreign policy shifted significantly following its victory in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895. As a result of this conflict, Japan gained control of Taiwan, marking a major expansion of its territorial influence and signaling its emergence as a significant imperial power in East Asia. This transition from a largely isolated nation to an active imperialist state reflects Japan's complex historical trajectory from the Edo period's seclusion to its modern imperial ambitions.\",2\n239,RYUKYU KINGDOM,\"The Ryukyu Kingdom was a vassal state of Qing China, situated in the Ryukyu Islands. Throughout its history, the kingdom maintained a tributary relationship with China, engaging in diplomatic and tributary exchanges that facilitated cultural and political interactions. As a tributary state, the Ryukyu Kingdom participated in diplomatic missions and tribute missions to China, which helped to establish and reinforce its status within the regional order. These exchanges contributed to the development of a unique cultural identity that blended indigenous Ryukyuan traditions with Chinese influences. The kingdom's diplomatic relations with China were characterized by formal diplomatic exchanges, including the sending of envoys and receiving Chinese officials, which underscored its subordinate but mutually beneficial relationship with the Qing dynasty. Overall, the Ryukyu Kingdom's role as a tributary state of China was central to its political, cultural, and diplomatic history during this period, shaping its interactions within East Asia and contributing to its distinctive cultural heritage.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n91,JAPAN,RYUKYU KINGDOM,Japan forced the Ryukyu Kingdom to become a Japanese domain in 1872,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
